============

## Data source 
	The data can be found at the following URL [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  "data cleaning zip files")


## Is the resulting data set a tidy data set? 

	From the definition of a tidy data set given by Hayley Wickham, there are three important elements to consider in design:

1. Each variable forms a column. 
1. 	Each observation forms a row. 
1. 	Each type of observational unit forms a table. 

	In the resulting data set described above, item 3 is the easiest one to prove since the data by definition is the result of a single form of observation. It is all data collected from a set of same experiments conducted on multiple test subjects - all with the same activity set.
